Bytes 1,2 Charge voltage goal. 0.1V Not sure the Sunny Island does anything with this. I suspect it errors out if battery goes above this
Bytes 3,4 Requested charge current, 0.1A
Bytes 5,6 Requested discharge current. 0.1A. Donâ€™t think SunnyIsland does anything with this. 
Bytes 7,8 Discharge voltage. 0.1V. Not sure the Sunny Island does anything with this. I suspect it errors out if battery goes below this.
